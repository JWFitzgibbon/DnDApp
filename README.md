# DnDApp

RESTful ASP.NET Core 7.0 API to help manage DnD characters and abilities for my campaign. WIP, uses a local MSSQL Database. 

18/03/2023 - Big reformat/redo, previous one had a messy file structure

23/03/2023 - Testing out a custom response handler in CharacterController; also added some empty files for the repository pattern

14/05/2023 - Been preoccupied with other things recently; however, I have added a custom response handler to both controllers and modified the AbilityController to also use the repository pattern because it was starting to annoy me. Believe I am getting to the point where I need to focus more on learning React (or MVC/Blazor, or both in different versions) to get a functional front end.

10/06/2023 - Setting up for some xUnit tests because its always good practice, less commits recently since I'm reading up on React and CSS frameworks so I can actually use the API on a decent looking page.
